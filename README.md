# 🚔 Crime-Rate-Prediction 🔍

## 🌟 Introduction
Welcome to the **Crime Rate Prediction** project! 🚨 This project is focused on analyzing and predicting crime rates in **San Francisco** 🏙️ using data science and machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data, we aim to uncover trends and provide insights that can help make our communities safer! 🌉✨

## 🎯 Features
- 🔧 **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Preparing raw crime data for analysis.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing crime trends in San Francisco.
- 📌 **Clustering with K-Medoids**: Grouping similar areas or patterns within the data.
- 🤖 **Classification with CatBoost**: Predicting crime categories with high accuracy.
- 🏆 **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the accuracy and performance of our predictions.
